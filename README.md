**FogMon 2.0 is available [here](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/FogMon/tree/liscio-2.0)!**

*[FogMon 2.0](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/FogMon/tree/liscio-2.0) has been released as a result of the experimental activities of the project *Lightweight Self-adaptive Cloud-IoT Monitoring across Fed4FIRE+ Testbeds (LiSCIo)* funded within the [*8th Fed4FIRE+ Competitive Call – Innovative Experiments | Category “Medium Experiments”*](https://www.fed4fire.eu/news/discover-the-8th-open-call-winners/). FogMon 2.0 was assessed and tuned in lifelike experimental settings on Cloud-IoT resources across the [Virtual Wall](https://www.fed4fire.eu/testbeds/virtual-wall/) and [CityLab](https://www.fed4fire.eu/testbeds/citylab/) testbeds, featuring 20, 30 and 40 monitored nodes.*
