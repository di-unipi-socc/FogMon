ASSOLO is a new active probing tool for estimating available
bandwidth developed by Emanuele Goldoni and Alberto Torelli
(University of Pavia).

ASSOLO re-uses basic low-level network functions of pathChirp,
another great measuremet tool devoleped by Vinay Ribeiro,
Ryan Christopher King and Niels Kang Hoven (Rice University).
A copy of pathChirp source code can be obtained from
http://www.spin.rice.edu/Software/pathChirp/

Some network functions of pathChirp are, in their turn, based on
the NetDyn tool. A copy of the original tool can be downloaded from
http://www.cs.umd.edu/~suman/netdyn/
